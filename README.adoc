= Real-Time Analytics with Apache Flink and Apache Pinot
:toc:
:toc-placement: preamble
:source-highlighter: highlight.js

A real-time analytics platform built with Apache Flink and Apache Pinot, designed to process and analyze product analytics data in real-time.

== Quick Start

=== Prerequisites
* Docker and Docker Compose
* Python 3.9+
* Poetry (Python package manager)
* Java 17+
* Gradle

=== Running the Platform

1. Start the infrastructure:
[source,bash]
----
docker compose up -d
----

2. Start the event generator:
[source,bash]
----
cd generator
poetry install
poetry run python -m analytics_generator
----

3. Launch the analytics dashboard:
[source,bash]
----
cd dashboard
poetry install
poetry run streamlit run src/analytics_dashboard/app.py
----

== Architecture Overview

The project consists of the following components:

* Event Generator (Python) - Generates synthetic product analytics events
* Apache Kafka 3.8.0 (Message Queue) - Running in KRaft mode without Zookeeper
* Apache Flink (Stream Processing) - Processes and aggregates events
* Apache Pinot (Real-time OLAP) - Stores and queries analytics data
* Streamlit Dashboard - Visualizes product analytics metrics
* Kafka UI (Monitoring) - Monitors Kafka topics and messages

== Product Analytics Dashboard

The dashboard provides real-time insights into product performance and revenue metrics:

=== Features
* Real-time metrics updates with configurable auto-refresh
* Preset time range selections (24h, 7d, 30d, custom)
* Product performance analysis
* Revenue tracking and analysis
* Conversion funnel visualization

=== Key Metrics
* View counts
* Cart additions
* Purchase conversions
* Revenue tracking
* Product category analysis

=== Data Schema

The `product_analytics` table in Pinot contains the following fields:

==== Dimension Fields
* `product_id` (string)
* `product_name` (string)
* `product_category` (string)

==== Metric Fields
* `view_count` (int)
* `cart_adds` (int)
* `purchases` (int)
* `revenue` (double)

==== Time Field
* `update_time` (timestamp in EPOCH milliseconds)
